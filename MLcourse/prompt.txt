Read through the firmware source code. Understand the application by reading through my ML course lectures and the project in the MLcourse folder. Write your files in the MLmodel folder. So the idea is to have 3 models, regression, random forest and a neural network. Use pytorch. The nerf gun has flywheels which need about 100ms to spin up. the model should predict based on the nerf_imu_data.csv which is formatted as this: accel_x,accel_y,accel_z,gyro_x,gyro_y,gyro_z,trigger_state 2124,-1595,488,-1625,-2591,-1566,0 1990,-1564,559,-1619,-2563,-1544,0

when a user is about to fire, say in a 100-400ms interval before a trigger pull.

But if you think about it we cannot have the flywheels 'spin up' multiple times per second because then they would just be twitching so we need to target a low false positives per second rate. In C++ I can also implement something like only spin up the flywheels if the model predicts 20 consecutive times or something.

Do some research on this kind of application and write the whole ML pipeline and make lots of performance metrics to analyse the 3 models. The neural net is aimed to get the best results but is not implementable on the RP2040 MCU. The random forest (keep it small enough) can run locally.

Do you need any more context?
