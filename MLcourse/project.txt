Slides are available below.

ML Project Intro_25-09-25.pptx



Form the team

Find a teammate to work on the project together.
Register for the feedback sessions (proposal feedback and milestone) once you have a teammate: Book your feedback sessions. The due date for booking the feedback sessions is Oct 16, 2025, 23:59:59 (CET time).
If you cannot find a teammate, please fill in this form by Oct 1, 2025, 23:59:59 (CEST time): Pair a teammate. You and your paired teammate will be contacted by email on the next day, and then you can book your feedback sessions.
Project Proposal

Once you've formed the team, discuss with your teammate carefully and propose a project.
The project can be selected from the recommended datasets or your free choice, following the requirements. Please check the project introduction slides for more information.
Once you've chosen the dataset, please follow the guidelines in the template below and prepare your proposal.
The final submission should be a PDF. Only one submission per group.
The submission channel is named 'Submission 1: Project Proposal' in Toledo / Ultra.
Submission due: Oct 16, 2025, 23:59:59 (CEST time).
If you have any questions or remarks, please contact meixing.liao@kuleuven.be with the email subject “ML project proposal”.
The proposal feedback session is scheduled on Oct 23. Don't forget to book your slot.
Template_Project Proposal.docx



Project Milestone

After the feedback on the proposal, you can start working on your project.
There will be a milestone checkpoint on Nov 27. To prepare for the milestone feedback session, please follow the guidelines in the template below and prepare your milestone update.
The final submission should be a PDF. Only one submission per group.
The submission channel is named 'Submission 2: Project Milestone' in Toledo / Ultra.
Submission due: Nov 20, 2025, 23:59:59 (CET time).
If you have any questions or remarks, please contact meixing.liao@kuleuven.be with the email subject “ML project milestone”.
The milestone feedback session follows the same slot you chose for the proposal feedback. Please find the slots via: Book your feedback sessions.
Template_Project Milestone.docx



Poster Presentation

Guidelines:

As part of the final evaluation, each team needs to present their results via a poster presentation on Dec 17.
To prepare for this poster presentation session, each team has to create a poster and print it out in size A1, vertically. 
Each team also has to submit the final poster as a PDF by Dec 16 in Ultra, under the submission channel 'Submission 3: Poster'. One submission per team. 
During the presentation, each team will be assessed by 2 evaluators separately. The interaction with each evaluator will last 15 minutes, with Q&A included. During this session, the evaluators will also provide you with feedback to improve your work, which you can later incorporate into your final report.
At the poster session, you'll also have an opportunity to see what everyone else did for their projects.
If you have any questions or remarks, please contact meixing.liao@kuleuven.be with the email subject “ML project poster”.
The group number, poster template, and past-year examples are attached below.
Suggestions:

Safer to reserve at least 2 days before the poster presentation session on Dec 17. 
Plotter services can be found at https://icts.kuleuven.be/sc/english/education/plotter.
For more information on how to make a scientific poster, please check https://admin.kuleuven.be/icts/english/research/dissemination/sciposter/acadposter.

Final Report

Guidelines:

After the poster presentation, you will have several days to incorporate the suggestions and feedback into the final report.
Please follow the guidelines in the template to prepare for your final report. The template is attached below.
The final submission should be a zip file, including a PDF of the report and the code. Only one submission per group.
Submission due: Jan 5, 2026, 23:59:59 (CET time).
Work distribution among team members must be clearly stated in the report.
If you have any questions or remarks, please contact meixing.liao@kuleuven.be with the email subject “ML project report”.

Grading

60% of the project score is based on the poster presentation, 40% on the report. Specifically, the evaluation will be based on the following categories:

Poster
Poster Design & Communication: Layout; visual clarity; concise text; logical flow; language and readability; time management; and interaction.
Technical Content & Understanding: Accuracy and clarity of problem definition, ML pipeline description, dataset explanation, preprocessing, model choice, metrics, and reasoning.
Results, Analysis & Reflection: Correctness and interpretation of results; use of figures; critical insight; limitations and lessons learned.
Broader Impact & Relevance: Link to real-world or scientific relevance, potential applications, clarity of motivation.


Report
Abstract: Summary of motivation, dataset, methods, key results, and conclusion within the required length.
Introduction & Motivation: Problem definition; clarity of motivation; relevance to real-world or scientific context; explicit input–output formulation.
Methods: Dataset description; clarity of source, size, feature type, class balance, preprocessing steps, and task suitability; model selection and justification; explanation of structure and parameters; tuning and validation strategy; appropriate use of metrics.
Results: Presentation and correctness of results; clarity and completeness of figures and tables; meaningful interpretation and discussion of outcomes.
Discussion: Interpretation of findings; comparison with literature; critical analysis of limitations; and integration of poster feedback or improvements.
Conclusion: Concise and coherent conclusion; summary of main findings and future perspectives.
Teamwork: clear contribution of each member.
Writing Quality & References: language, structure, scientific rigor.
Optional FYI: Additional Hands-on Tutorials
